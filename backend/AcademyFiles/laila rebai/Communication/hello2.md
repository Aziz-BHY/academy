# Hello, can you hear me?

## I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

- When we were younger and free
- I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
- There's such a difference between us
- And a million miles

## Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times

To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside

## At least I can say that I've tried

1. To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
2. But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
3. Hello, how are you?
