## **Color Picker**

Use the color picker by clicking and dragging your cursor inside the picker area to highlight a color on the right. Input Hex, RGB, HSL or CMYK values to search for a particular color in the fields below the color swatch; click the swatch to add it to your palette. After selecting a color, experiment with different harmonies by using the dropdown below the color picker.

## **Color Harmonies**

Color harmonies are particularly pleasing combinations of two or more colors derived from their relationship on a color wheel. Also known as color chords, color harmonies are useful when exploring a possible color palette, or can be used as a standalone color scheme.

#### **COMPLEMENTARY COLORS**

Colors that are directly opposite one another on the color wheel are known as complementary colors. Complementary colors have a high contrast and can be very effective as accent colors when paired with a more neutral palette.

#### **TRIADIC COLORS**

Triadic harmonies consist of three colors equidistant from one another on the color wheel. Like complementary colors, triadic schemes tend to be very bright with a high contrast and work best when one color dominates.

#### **TETRADIC COLORS**

# Tetradic color harmonies are formed by two sets of complementary colors 60 degrees apart on the color wheel. Tetradic schemes are an excellent starting point for creating color palettes; fine tune them using color shades, tints and tones.
